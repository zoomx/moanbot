# Hacking the logic #

The included Example1 program is just the starting point. Moanbot has 5 sensors to experiment with. The full Arduino language is available to you. How about using random numbers to make Moanbot less predictable?

# Hacking the circuitry #

How about changing LEDs? Or adding different sensors?

# Hacking the look #

Moanbot can be dressed or accessorised with card, fabric or other non-conductive materials. Moanbot's face can be programmed with a variety of custom expressions.

# Hacking the sound #

Moanbot has plenty of room for lots of custom sounds. A 2GB SD card can store hours of sounds in thousands of different clips.
