# Recording sound #

Record your sound using a good quality microphone. Try to keep a consistent strong sound level. [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is a free program that can be useful for trimming sounds and adjusting levels.

Moanbot can only play files that:
  * are in WAV format
  * have a 4 digit filename such as 1234.WAV
  * are 8 or 16 bit uncompressed files
  * are stored on a FAT formatted SD or SDHC card.
