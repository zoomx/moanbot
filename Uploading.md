Moanbot is programmed by connecting the Arduino USB port with a standard USB cable. Programming can be done with or without the Moanbot shield in place.

Sound can be uploaded by removing the SD card from the socket and inserting it into an SD card reader. Turn off Moanbot before inserting the SD card.
