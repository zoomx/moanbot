To install Moanbot, you will require Arduino 21 or later. The Arduino software is downloadable from the [Arduino project](http://arduino.cc).

## Downloading files ##

The latest Moanbot library is available from the [Downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/moanbot/downloads/list). Once it has downloaded, extract the files.

## Arduino user libraries ##

There should be a folder within your Arduino sketch folder called `libraries`. If not, create an empty folder. Copy the `Moanbot` folder into the `libraries` folder.

## Checking everything is working ##

If you have the Arduino software running, close it down. Now open Arduino. Under `Files > Examples`, you should see Moanbot appearing. If you can load up `Example1`, the installation is complete.
