Moanbot is a shield that transforms an Arduino into a robot shape, adding sensors, sound playback and an expressive display. Moanbot is complete, but utterly hackable at all skill levels. Modifications include Moanbot costumes, new speech in multiple languages, altered the displays and reprogrammed sensor algorithms.
